# Intelligent-Vision-Based-Object-Detection
Weâ€™re building a fast, accurate object detection system using YOLOv3 and TensorFlow. It processes the whole image at once for real-time performance. The model will be trained on datasets like COCO and PASCAL VOC, with techniques like NMS for better results. An interactive tool will allow easy image uploads and detections.
